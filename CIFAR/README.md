## DCNN Architecture on CIFAR-10 Dataset

    
### Keras Functional API for Deep Learning Architecture was use, which included Normal Convolution followed by Spatially Separable Convolution, Depth-wise Separable Convolution and Max-polling and 1x1 to reduce size and number of channel and also Grouped Convolution. The Model had 786,570 parameters with batch-size of 128 and 15 epoch, which resulted in an accuracy of  76.71
